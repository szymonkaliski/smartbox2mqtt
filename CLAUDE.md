Use `PROJECT.md` for tracking changes and implementing features.

Each feature starts with `## Feature: Name`.

Todos are tracked like so:

```
- [x] scaffold a React project using `vite` @done(2025-07-09)
- [ ] install `useImmer` and replace `useState` with a single state atom
```

As you go and the todos are added, update them and create new ones. Sub-todos and sub-sub todos are ok too.

Both me and you can edit the file. I'll let you know when I edit it.

If I tell you about something important to remember, like how to run the project, how to format it, etc. add this to the top of the `PROJECT.md` in the relevant section, so you can remember this for the next time we work.
